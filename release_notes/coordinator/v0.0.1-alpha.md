# Coordinator v0.0.1-alpha

## Overview

Initial alpha release of the Project Xylen coordinator service. This release provides core ensemble trading functionality with risk management and real-time monitoring.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- Ensemble decision-making with weighted voting and Bayesian aggregation
- Multi-model support (4+ concurrent model servers)
- Binance Futures API integration (testnet and mainnet)
- Real-time market data collection and feature engineering
- WebSocket server for dashboard communication
- SQLite persistence for trades and system events

### Risk Management

- Configurable position sizing (fixed fraction, Kelly Criterion, fixed amount)
- Automatic stop loss and take profit placement
- Circuit breakers for consecutive losses
- Daily loss limits (percentage and absolute)
- Emergency shutdown on extreme drawdown
- Position and leverage limits

### Monitoring and Alerts

- WebSocket broadcasting of system status (60s intervals)
- Telegram integration for trade and error alerts
- Prometheus metrics export
- Comprehensive logging with rotation
- Trade and decision audit trail

### Technical

- Python 3.10 with async/await architecture
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Modular design (ensemble, risk manager, market data, etc.)
- Configuration via YAML with environment variable support
- Automatic reconnection and retry logic

## Configuration

### Key Parameters

- Ensemble confidence threshold: 0.70 (default)
- Heartbeat interval: 60 seconds
- Model timeout: 5 seconds
- Health check interval: 300 seconds
- Maximum open positions: 1
- Leverage: 1x (configurable up to 125x)

### Supported Ensemble Methods

- weighted_vote: Simple weighted majority
- bayesian_weighted: Advanced Bayesian aggregation (default)
- average_confidence: Average all model predictions

## Installation

1. Extract coordinator package
2. Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml`
3. Create `.env` with Binance API credentials
4. Run: `docker compose up -d coordinator`

## Requirements

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- 512MB RAM minimum (1GB recommended)
- Binance Futures API credentials

## Breaking Changes

None (initial release)

## Known Issues

- Binance API signature errors on some testnet configurations (non-critical)
- WebSocket clients may occasionally disconnect (auto-reconnect within 5s)
- SQLite not optimized for high-frequency trading (use PostgreSQL for HFT)

## Upgrade Instructions

Not applicable (initial release)

## Security Notes

- API keys stored in environment variables only
- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use testnet credentials for testing
- Enable IP whitelist on Binance API keys
- Monitor API key usage regularly
